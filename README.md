## The Project

This project was a first realease of a programming course. The focus is to show our evolution during 8 months of course.


## The Solution
The solution was to build a world map where it was possible to click in some countries and hace access to some news around the world.

Only 5 countries were experimented: Brazil, USA, Italy, France and Spain.


## Technology
This project was made in JS using Angular 1 lib.

## How to install
Do a `git clone` in a local repository and `npm install` after to install all the dependencies.

## Note
Due to the lack of time and technology, cause today we don't have the Angular 1 support anymore,
it is possible that something may not work well.
